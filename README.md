The RESTful API for the Vets 4 Warriors Counselor Resource Project (V4WCRP) written in python using Flask microframework.


## Basic guides  
The Flask Framework is super small. It is contained all in the app/ directory. We should run this inside of a virtualenv
created from the requirements.txt file.  
This can be easily setup in Pycharm!  

To install:  
*pip install -r requirements.txt*  
To save env:  
*pip freeze > requirements.txt*
